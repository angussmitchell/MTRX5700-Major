# MTRX5700-Major

## Dancing Drone

###Equipment we need:

- either one big drone or two small ones

- microphone

- controller hardware

- speakers

- rpi maybe

### Things we want to achieve in order of priority

(1) make the drone move - and then try more complicated moves

(2) make it return back to its original starting position on the ground

(3) drone that moves in time with music - pre-loaded, steps are pre-planned

    (a) not crash into shit

    (b) pick out bars first

    (c) if the drone is fast enough, try smaller chunks - choreography

    (c) phrases - notes and stuff - might be hard

(4) drone that moves in time with live music - use the mic, do filtering

(5) movement/visual spectrum analyser
