The aim of our project is to create a dancing drone using the Parrot AR Drone 2.0 Power Edition. In order to set ourselves some challenges with our dancing drone, we decided on a set features that we would want our drone to be capable, including: (1) executing dance moves in synchronisation with music as amplified through a speaker, (2) implementing sound processing to detect beats within the music, as well as different sections and moods within the piece of music to determine which dance move to next execute, (3) confining the drone to a volume of space within which it may dance and move, so as to avoid obstacles, (4) responding to a song of the user's choosing by performing real-time sound processing. These four sets of features and challenges form the scope of our dancing drone project.
