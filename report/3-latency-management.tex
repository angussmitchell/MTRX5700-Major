\subsection{Latency Management}

%%NEILL: multithreading stuff, how dance moves are synchronised with the music, peculiarities with the drone software, how to specify the length of moves, etc...
%I don't know if you wanna about how some of the dance moves were hardcoded ^_^"
% optional: live stuff, like how there is a bit of latency before the drone starts moving because it takes a few beats to confirm a high enough confidence of bpm

Latency is an important aspect of the dancing drone solution, as the drone must perform a move suitably fast in
order to appear visually pleasing and in time with the music. Experimentally, we determined that almost all of
the time the drone will begin to respond to a command within 5ms of receiving it, however in some cases the
drone's response was delayed by up to 20ms. A discussion of how latency affected each module and how they were
synchronized is included in the modular breakdown of the software earlier in this report.
