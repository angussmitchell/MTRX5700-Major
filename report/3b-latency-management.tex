\subsection{Latency Management}

%%NEILL: multithreading stuff, how dance moves are synchronised with the music, peculiarities with the drone software, how to specify the length of moves, etc...
%I don't know if you wanna about how some of the dance moves were hardcoded ^_^"
% optional: live stuff, like how there is a bit of latency before the drone starts moving because it takes a few beats to confirm a high enough confidence of bpm
