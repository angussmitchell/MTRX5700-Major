\section{Conclusions and Future Work} % section could also be called future work

In conclusion, while many of the dancing drones viewable on the internet have a
hard-coded routine, our dancing drone solution was able to meet our goal of dancing to
a previously unknown song. The greatest challenges were using the ARDrone2 animations,
as they operate in a different way than specified in Parrot's SDK. Writing an entire
wrapper class (the drone dancer module) for the drone's physical movements along with
asynchronous operation of each module were required to facilitate our desired behaviour.
In the future, more dance moves and genres could be added, along with bar detection
as well as beat detection. Further audio analysis would also allow for more variation
between moves and different parts of a song, for example using the pitch or key.
For future projects, a smaller, lighter stunt drone would be more suitable.
